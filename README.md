## Hi there! 👋

I see you're stalking my profile. Welcome!

I'm Prae, a UX Engineer who loves helping people make accessible web products, and the host of [Web Access Club podcast](https://webaccessclub.com/).

I also care deeply about user experience, sustainable software development, cross discipline collaboration, and growing front-end capabilities in and out of organisations.

I'm particularly keen on food (eating and making), watercolours painting, photography (food, landscapes, and astro), and Kyudo (Japanese archery). Please feel free to ask me anything related to those topics!

### Currently...

- ✨ Working on ways to inspire and empower web creators to make **digital accessibility** an integral part of their process
- 🌱 Plotting to grow more front-end capabilities at work
- 💻 Gathering requirements for New Zealand Kyudo Federation's website and membership portal
- 📚 Learning A11y, modern JS, React, micro-front end, and watercolour painting
- 🤔 Looking to connect with other web accessibility practitioners!

### Other notes

- 🙌 Keen to collaborate on non-profit projects that needs a bit of UX love
- 🏹 Fun fact: I've been a Kyudo (Japanese Archery) practitioner since 2013
