## Hello! 👋

I see you're stalking my profile. There ain't much here, but I'm working to improve that situation!

🍵 CSS, HTML, UX, accessibility, design & dev collab, and growing frontend capablities are my jam. Please feel free to ask me anything related to those topics!

### Currently...

- 💻 Gathering requirements for New Zealand Kyudo Federation's website and membership portal
- 🌱 Plotting to grow more frontend capabilities at work
- 📚 Learning A11y, modern JS (neglected it for too long), React, micro-front end, and watercolour painting
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with optimising JS in a modern way

### Other notes

- 🙌 Keen to collaborate on non-profit projects that needs a bit of UX love
- 🏹 Fun fact: I've been a Kyudo (Japanese Archery) practitioner since 2013
